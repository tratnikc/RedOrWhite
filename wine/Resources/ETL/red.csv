Sourced from roughly 80-year-old vines, this is a little different because it was held for six months after bottling in a cement tank filled with fresh water (as with the Nautilus white this issue). Perhaps the best red table wine I've seen from the winery, this is sophisticated and flavorful with fine structure. Textured, silky and precise, it has nuanced fruit flavors, with cranberries and baked plums, plus a tight, tense finish. The mid-palate finesse is exceptional. The acidity supports the fruit nicely, lifts it and allows the flavors to linger. There is also a serious backbone, but the tannins are ripe enough so that they never go overboard. You can open this now if you must - give it an hour of air if you do - but it will certainly be better in a year or two. It should age pretty well, but let's take that in stages. How well it ages, whether it develops or merely holds, will determine how impressive it really is. Drink date: 2020-2032. Score - 91.

Those scorching weather conditions have further contributed to the richness and concentration of the fruit you get here. After harvest, the grapes are laid out to dry for 120 days, and during that process, they lose up to one-third of their water mass, tightening and further concentrating that distinctive richness. After the grapes are destemmed, pressed and fermented, the wine goes into French barrique for two years, followed by an additional two years to refine in large oak casks. Dried blackberry and plum segue to spice, smoke and tar. The wine is soft in terms of mouthfeel, with impressive textural richness. Drink date: 2019-2035.  Score - 94.

The finish is long, with a tannic tug offset by citrus-kissed acidity, along with lingering red berry fruit and spice.

The vines are planted at an altitude of 80 to 100 meters above sea level in blue clay soils that are unique to Bolgheri. That ideal position opens the vineyards to soft breezes, proximity to the sea, long daylight hours and cool diurnal shifts from the protective wall of low mountains at the back. It's a little garden of Merlot Eden. The center of the vineyard now is home to the new Masseto winery and an adjacent tasting room built into a pre-existing farmhouse. This wine was made in the old winery (the existing Ornellaia winery). Fermentation kicks off in a combination of steel and oak tanks before the wine is racked over to barrique, where it rests for two years. The wine then goes into bottle for 12 months before its release ... It is powerful, but that's always the case with Masseto (this vintage records a 15.5% alcohol content) ...
